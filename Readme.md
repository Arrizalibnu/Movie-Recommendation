# Recommendeation Movie System ðŸŽ¬
This project is my project on machine learning or deep learning in the field of NLP (Natural Languange Processing) to get film recommendations for users based on the history of the user and the rating given.

The model developed in this project uses NCF (Nueral Collaborative Fltering) architecture and dataset to build this model from [kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset). This project was build using different tools, such as: google colab to process data and train the model, visual studio code to create an API for the model, and deployment using AWS and HuggingFace hub.
